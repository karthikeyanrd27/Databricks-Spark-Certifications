Sample transformations : 

Syntax : sample(withreplacement,fraction,seed = none)

x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
b = sc.parallelize(x)
c =b.sample(True,1,5)
c.collect()

Out[18]: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10]


Sample = True 
Sample = False 

Difference between withreplacement is True means

Example , 

10 balls in backets 

taking white Ball 1 

probalbilty 1/10

Again we keep that ball in backets and taking another Ball .. 

In This scenario also probality of white ball is 1/10


Withreplacement = False 

in this secneaio after taking white ball , probabilty of another ball would be 1/9 . this is concept		


Random split : 

We can take the sample based on the weight value 


rdd = sc.parallelize(range(10))
rdd.collect()
test,train = rdd.randomSplit(weights=[0.3,0.7],seed =1)
test.collect()
train.collect()
